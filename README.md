# Laravel OOP Config

Laravel OOP Config is a package that enables developers to generate object-oriented wrappers for Laravel configuration files. This approach enhances code readability, provides IDE autocompletion, and ensures type safety when accessing configuration values.

## Features

- Generate PHP classes for Laravel config files.
- Access configuration values through typed methods.
- Batch generation of config classes.
- Seamless integration with Laravel's service container.
- Customizable stubs for generated classes.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require veiliglanceren/laravel-oop-config --dev
```

To publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config
```

## Configuration

After publishing, the configuration file `config/oop-config.php` will be available. You can customize the following settings:

- `namespace`: The namespace for the generated config classes (default: `App\Config`).
- `path`: The directory path where the config classes will be stored (default: `app/Config`).
- `autoload`: Whether to automatically register generated config classes (default: `true`).
- `stubs`: Paths to custom stubs for class and method generation.

## Usage

### Generating a Config Class

To generate a class for a specific config file:

```bash
php artisan make:config config_key
```

Replace `config_key` with the name of the config file (without the `.php` extension). For example, to generate a class for `config/mail.php`:

```bash
php artisan make:config mail
```

This will create a class `App\Config\MailConfig` with methods corresponding to the configuration keys.

### Generating Classes for All Config Files

To generate classes for all config files:

```bash
php artisan config:generate-all
```

Use the `--force` option to overwrite existing classes:

```bash
php artisan config:generate-all --force
```

### Accessing Configuration Values

Once generated, you can access configuration values using the generated classes:

```php
use App\Config\MailConfig;

$mailConfig = app(MailConfig::class);

$host = $mailConfig->host();
$port = $mailConfig->port();
```

For nested configuration values, methods are generated by concatenating the keys in camelCase:

```php
$fromAddress = $mailConfig->fromAddress();
```

### Customizing Stubs

You can customize the generated classes by modifying the stub files. Publish the stubs using:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=stubs
```

This will publish the stub files to the `stubs` directory, where you can modify them as needed.

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
```

Ensure that your test environment is properly configured.
